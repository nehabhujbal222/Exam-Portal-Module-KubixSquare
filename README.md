# Exam-Portal-Module

This project was developed as a part of my internship at [KubixSquare](https://kubixsquare.com/), Mumbai. It provides a great start to build your own auto-grading system. It aims to cut the tedious hours spent in correcting the theory answers of students on tests/exams. The proposed module presents the final grade attained on any given test within seconds.
